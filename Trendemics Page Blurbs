Welcome to Trendemics!
With this website, we attempt to provide tools for the visualization of worldwide and US state specific COVID data, along with interesting and possibly related factors in demography, mobility patterns, and government responses. It is our hope that the analysis of trends in COVID cases can be correlated with potentially influencing factors, supporting the emergence of patterns that may spur further research and direct public health efforts.
